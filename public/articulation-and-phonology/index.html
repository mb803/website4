 A child with an articulation disorder may have difficulty with one or more specific sounds that impact their overall ability to be effectively understood. A child with a phonological disorder may have difficulty producing patterns of speech sounds. For example, the phonological process of “cluster reduction” refers to a child who typically says 1 sound instead of 2 ; a child who says “top” for &lsquo;stop&rsquo; or “sick” for &lsquo;stick&rsquo; would be identified with this phonological pattern." />

<li>A child with an <strong>articulation disorder</strong> may have difficulty with one or more specific sounds that impact their overall ability to be effectively understood.</li>
<li>A child with a <strong>phonological disorder</strong> may have difficulty producing patterns of speech sounds. For example, the phonological process of “cluster reduction” refers to a child who typically says 1 sound instead of 2 ; a child who says “top” for &lsquo;stop&rsquo; or “sick” for &lsquo;stick&rsquo; would be identified with this phonological pattern.</li>
</ul>
<p>As children grow up, their sound development follows a typical hierarchy; it is expected for young children to make some speech errors as they grow. We can assess your child for their sound-production in words, sentences, and conversation to determine if they would benefit from therapeutic services.</p>
