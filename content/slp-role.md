_Speech Language Pathologist, Speech Therapist, Speech Teacher, Feeding Therapist, SLP_â€¦ the list of  names we can be called is seemingly endless. Many are unsure of what to call us and more importantly, unsure of what we do and when to seek out our help.

Formally speaking, a speech language pathologist (SLP) is a professional that diagnoses and treats people of all ages for speech, language, social, cognitive, and feeding disorders. We can work in a variety of settings: schools, private clinics, hospitals, in the house, rehabilitation centers, and more.

An SLP often works closely with other professionals including occupational therapists (OT), physical therapists (PT), psychologists, teachers, pediatricians, ear, nose and throat doctors (ENTs), dentists, and orthodontists. Most often, a team-based approach including all professionals and family members leads to great progress in our clients.

Here at MollyBSLP, we specialize in working with babies, children,  adolescents, and teens on speech, language and feeding therapy.  We provide virtual speech therapy in New York, New Jersey, and Virginia. Additionally, we provide home-based speech therapy in New Jersey within a limited coverage area.
