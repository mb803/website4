_Speech Language Pathologist, Speech Therapist, Speech Teacher, Feeding Therapist, SLP_â€¦ the list of  names we can be called is seemingly endless. Many are unsure of what to call us and more importantly, unsure of what we do and when to seek out our help.

Formally speaking, a speech language pathologist (SLP) is a professional that diagnoses and treats people of all ages for speech, language, social, cognitive, and feeding disorders within a variety of settings.

## What does an SLP do?

As mentioned above, the scope of an SLP is very broad. Speech Language Therapists can work with clients on the following areas:

* **Speech:** This is spoken language and the sounds we use to speak. SLPs can work on the speech sounds one makes and how well someone is understood (intelligibility). Articulation, Phonological Processes, Childhood Apraxia of Speech (CAS), and even stuttering can fall into this category.
* **Language:**  This refers to _how_ we use our speech sounds to communicate with others.
  * **Receptive Language:** Our understanding of language. This can include following of directions, learning new vocabulary words, understanding stories, and more.
  * **Expressive Language:** Our use of language. This can include telling stories and narratives, using age-appropriate grammar and vocabulary, describing objects, and more.
  * **Pragmatic Language:** Our social use of language. Some may need support to learn common social rules like turn-taking, topic maintenance, and appropriate eye gaze to improve making friends, participating in groups, and working together in school.
* **Cognition:** Cognitive processing is vital for language. Cognitive skills include: attention, memory, organization, problem solving, inferences, executive functioning, and more.
* **Feeding:** Yes, SLPs are feeding therapists, too! We can work with babies on their feeding development: learning to eat solids, learning to use a spoon and fork, transitioning from bottle and pacifiers to straw cups and open cups, and more. Pediatric SLPs can also work with picky eaters to expand their food repertoire and eat adventurously.

## Who does a speech language pathologist work with?

Speech Language Therapists can work with clients across the lifespan. This includes our littlest babies up to our beloved elderly population. There is no age minimum or limit to needing, receiving and benefitting from speech therapy.

At MollyBSLP, we specialize in the pediatric population:

* **Early intervention (EI) population**
* **Preschoolers**
* **School students K-12**

Additionally, an SLP often works closely with other professionals within a team-based approach. Other professionals on a child's team can include:  occupational therapists (OT), physical therapists (PT), psychologists, teachers, pediatricians, ear, nose and throat doctors (ENTs), dentists, orthodontists, nutritionists, and audiologists. Most often, a team-based approach with all professionals who work with a child leads to great progress.

Most importantly, however, an SLP should be consistently collaborating with a child's family members. It is important to note that a child spends the majority of his or her day with their family members: mothers, fathers, siblings, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and other caretakers. It is vital that a speech therapist works closely with a client's family members to promote carryover of strategies and activities at home beyond the speech therapy sessions.

## Where do SLPs work?

As previously mentioned, speech therapists can work in a variety of settings:

* Schools (public, private, and charter schools)
* Daycare centers
* Private clinics and office spaces
* In the client's home
* Virtually
* In-patient hospitals
* Out-patient rehabilitative centers
* Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNF)
* Residential and non-residential health care facilities
* Colleges and Universities

Here at MollyBSLP, we primarily provide virtual speech therapy in Virginia and New York. We have found that virtual speech sessions allow for increased convenience for families as well as improved family engagement in the child's therapies. 

## What should I look for in a speech therapist for my child?

It is important that your speech language pathologist is a good fit for your child and your family. The field of speech language pathology is not a one-type-fits-all system. There are many valid approaches, techniques, and perspectives within the field. Because of this, it is important that both your family and your child feel comfortable and supported by your speech  therapist.

At MollyBSLP, we focus on a child-led approach. Research and experience have shown that following a child's lead and interests can lead to improved engagement and ultimately great progress. We implement a play-based approach whenever possible and consistently include a child's interests into our therapy sessions. Our mission is to make mundane worksheets, drill-work, and learning more engaging for all of our clients. We have found that this promotes intrinsic motivation and a learning-supportive environment. For progress to happen, it is important that our clients feel safe and supported first.

## When do I need to look for a speech therapist for my child?

At MollyBSLP, we do not believe in the "wait-and-see" approach. We strongly feel that if you have any concerns regarding your child's speech, language, or feeding development it is best to find a speech therapist to speak with and possibly evaluate your child for further information. In some instances, children get evaluated through a state-funded program or school district and do not qualify for services; if this has happened to your child but you still have concerns, we recommend reaching out to us to further discuss your child and your concerns. Most importantly, if you ever feel increased stress or anxiety regarding your child's speech, language, or feeding development, that is more than enough reason to reach out to a professional for guidance and support.

## How do I find a speech therapist near me?

Here at MollyBSLP, we specialize in therapy for toddlers, children, adolescents, and teens working on speech, language and feeding goals.  We provide virtual speech therapy in New York and Virginia.
