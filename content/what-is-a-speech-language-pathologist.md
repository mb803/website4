_Speech Language Pathologist, Speech Therapist, Speech Teacher, Feeding Therapist, SLP_â€¦ the list of  names we can be called is seemingly endless. Many are unsure of what to call us and more importantly, unsure of what we do and when to seek out our help.

Formally speaking, a speech language pathologist (SLP) is a professional that diagnoses and treats people of all ages for speech, language, social, cognitive, and feeding disorders. We can work in a variety of settings: schools, private clinics, hospitals, in the house, rehabilitation centers, and more.

## What does an SLP do?

As mentioned above, the scope of an SLP is very broad. Speech Therapists can work with clients on the following areas:

* **Speech:** SLPs can work on the speech sounds one makes and how well someone is understood (intelligibility). Articulation, Phonological Processes, Childhood Apraxia of Speech (CAS), and even stuttering can fall into this category. 
* **Language:**  This refers to _how_ we use our speech sounds to communicate with others. 
  * **Receptive Language:** Our understanding of language. This includes following directions, learning new vocabulary words, understanding stories, and more.
  * **Expressive Language:** Our use of language. This includes telling stories and narratives, using age-appropriate grammar and vocabulary, describing objects, and more. 
  * **Pragmatic Language:** Our use of language to communicate socially with others. While it is important to respect an individual's limits and not force any social constructs onto someone, some children need support to learn common social rules like turn-taking, topic maintenance, and appropriate eye gaze to improve making friends, participating in groups, and working together in school. 
* **Cognition:** Cognitive processing is vital for language. Cognitive skills include: attention, memory, organization, problem solving, inferences, executive functioning, and more. 
* **Feeding:** Yes, SLPs are feeding therapists, too! We can work with babies on their feeding development: learning to eat solids, learning to use a spoon and fork, transitioning from bottle and pacifiers to straw cups and open cups, and more. Pediatric SLPs can also work with picky eaters to expand their food repertoire and eat adventurously. 

## Who does a speech language pathologist work with?

An SLP often works closely with other professionals occupational therapists (OT), physical therapists (PT), psychologists, teachers, pediatricians, ear, nose and throat doctors (ENTs), dentists, and orthodontists. Most often, a team-based approach with all professionals who work with a child leads to great progress.

Primarily, an SLP should be consistently collaborating with a child's family members. It is important to note that a child spends the majority of his or her day with their family members: mothers, fathers, siblings, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and other caretakers. It is vital that a speech therapist work closely with family members to promote carryover of strategies and activities at home beyond the speech therapy sessions.
