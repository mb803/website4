We know that it can be frustrating when your child isn’t able to be easily understood when sharing wonderful stories about their day, interests, and dreams.

* A child with an **articulation disorder** may have difficulty with one or more specific sounds that impact their overall ability to be effectively understood.
* A child with a **phonological disorder** may have difficulty producing patterns of speech sounds. For example, the phonological process of “cluster reduction” refers to a child who typically says 1 sound instead of 2 ; a child who says “top” for 'stop' or “sick” for 'stick' would be identified with this phonological pattern.

As children grow up, their sound development follows a typical hierarchy; it is expected for young children to make some speech errors as they grow. We can assess your child for their sound-production in words, sentences, and conversation to determine if they would benefit from therapeutic services.
