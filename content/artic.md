While there are moments where it is adorable to hear our little ones say _“wabbit”_ when talking about bunnies, _“lello”_ when talking about the color of the sun, or even seeing their tongue pop out when hissing like a snake, these are all signs that they may need speech therapy.

## Types of Speech Disorders

Typically, speech sound disorders are thought of as "R" an "S" sounds. However, speech sound disorders is am umbrella term refer to many different types of  speech deficits that children can have. Three of the main categories of speech sound disorders are **Childhood Apraxia of Speech (CAS),** **Phonological Processes** and **Articulation Errors**. Some speech sound irregularities are expected as our little ones grow and develop, but if they persist, your child may need further intervention.

## Articulation Disorders

**Articulation** **Errors** are typically related to misplacing our tongue, lips, or other articulators. Below you’ll find the typical age we can expect little ones to begin saying certain sounds and examples:

While the above developmental norms are important when considering if a child may benefit from speech therapy, there are other variables that should also be considered:

* **Family history:** A family history of speech or learning difficulties is important to be aware of. While this is not a determinant of your child’s abilities, they may benefit from earlier intervention rather than the “wait and see” approach.
* **Presence of phonological processes:** Check out this blog post on phonological errors and the ages we expect children to eliminate them.
* **Intelligibility**: This is the percentage that a child is understood by others. We want 3 year olds to be 75% intelligible and 4 year olds to be 100% intelligible by unfamiliar listeners. If your child is very unintelligible, regardless of what sounds they have, they may benefit from speech services.
* **Difficulty learning to read and write:** Children with speech sound disorders are at a higher risk of literacy-related delays
* **Social and emotional impact:** If your child is particularly aware and self-conscious of their speech errors, it may impact their social engagement with their peers at school and extracurricular activities.
