**Articulation Disorders**

While there are moments where it is adorable to hear our little ones say _“wabbit”_ when talking about bunnies, _“lello”_ when talking about the color of the sun, or even seeing their tongue pop out when hissing like a snake, these are all signs that they may need speech therapy from a speech language pathologist.

Typically, speech errors can be broken down into two main categories: **Phonological Processes** and **Articulation Errors**. Some speech sound irregularities are expected as our little ones grow and develop, but if they persist, your child may need further intervention.

**Articulation** **Errors** are typically related to misplacing our tongue, lips, or other articulators. Below you’ll find the typical age we can expect little ones to begin saying certain sounds and examples:

While the above developmental norms are important when considering if a child may benefit from speech therapy, there are other variables that should also be considered:

* **Family history:** A family history of speech or learning difficulties is important to be aware of. While this is not a determinant of your child’s abilities, they may benefit from earlier intervention rather than the “wait and see” approach.
* **Presence of phonological processes:** Check out this blog post on phonological errors and the ages we expect children to eliminate them.
* **Intelligibility**: This is the percentage that a child is understood by others. We want 3 year olds to be 75% intelligible and 4 year olds to be 100% intelligible by unfamiliar listeners. If your child is very unintelligible, regardless of what sounds they have, they may benefit from speech services.
* **Difficulty learning to read and write:** Children with speech sound disorders are at a higher risk of literacy-related delays
* **Social and emotional impact:** If your child is particularly aware and self-conscious of their speech errors, it may impact their social engagement with their peers at school and extracurricular activities.

Do you have concerns about your child’s speech development?
