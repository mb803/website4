**Do you take insurance?**

We presently are presently a private-pay service provider. This means that we are considered "out of network" to your health insurance. Using an out of network, private pay provider allows you to get the support that best suits your child and family's needs, not limiting you to any health insurance plan policies. 

We are able to provide you with a "superbill" or invoice that can be submitted to your insurance company should qualify for and you choose to receive out of network benefits. 

**Do you provide in-person sessions?**

We presently offer in-person visits on an as-needed basis within a limited coverage area. These sessions can take place in your home, your child's daycare, or in the local community (like the park or library).  Please reach out with any questions specific to your child or area. 

**Does my child need speech therapy?**

**How do I get started?**

[Let's get in touch.](/#let-s-get-in-touch) We will schedule a commitment-free complimentary phone consultation to determine whether we can be of assistance to your child and family. 

**How long are sessions?**

Therapy sessions are typically 30-45 minutes based on your child's individual needs.
