**Do you take insurance?**

* We  are presently a private-pay service provider. This means that we are considered "out of network" to your health insurance. Using an out of network, private pay provider allows you to get the support that best suits your child and family's needs, not limiting you to any health insurance plan policies.
* We are able to provide you with a "superbill" or invoice that can be submitted to your insurance company should qualify for and you choose to receive out of network benefits.

**Why virtual sessions?**

* Virtual sessions allows for an increased convenience of meeting with you and your child in a space where they are most comfortable. No need for you to leave the house, we will meet you right where you are. In our virtual sessions, we use a play-based approach to keep even the toddlers and those busy-movers motivated in a session.  Meeting virtually allows for an infinite amount of resources to be used at our fingertips and provides a safe-space for parent coaching for successful carryover of therapy techniques to your every day.

**I live in (State), can you work with my child?**

* We are presently licensed and able to work with clients in New York and Virginia.

**Does my child need speech therapy?**

* To help make this decision, we always begin with a complete assessment (unless you have already had one within the calendar year) to determine if therapy is needed.
* Whether your child was determined eligible for therapy through Early Intervention or their school district services or not, we are here to provide additional support and to foster growth and development. The more support we can provide children the better.
