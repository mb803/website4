**Do you take insurance?**

* We presently are presently a private-pay service provider. This means that we are considered "out of network" to your health insurance. Using an out of network, private pay provider allows you to get the support that best suits your child and family's needs, not limiting you to any health insurance plan policies.
* We are able to provide you with a "superbill" or invoice that can be submitted to your insurance company should qualify for and you choose to receive out of network benefits.

In our virtual sessions, we use a play-based approach to keep even the toddlers and those busy-movers motivated in a session.  Meeting virtually allows for an infinite amount of resources to be used at our fingertips and provides a safe-space for parent coaching for successful carryover of therapy techniques to your every day.
