When your little one first starts to talk, your first reaction may be to film everything they say because, well, it is just so adorable when they say “Goggy ay da tick” when they were really trying to tell you "The doggy ate the stick." Those videos will be fondly watched for ages and used at birthday parties, family get togethers, and celebrations for years to come, however, depending on your child's age, they may benefit from working with a speech therapist.

## Types of Speech Sound Disorders

Typically, speech sound disorders are thought of as a child having difficulty with the“R” or the “S” sounds. However, speech sound disorders is an umbrella term that can refer to many different types of speech deficits that children can have. Three of the main categories of speech sound disorders are **Childhood Apraxia of Speech (CAS),** **Phonological Processes** and **Articulation Errors**.

Typically, speech sound disorders are characterized by a deletion of a sound from a word, addition of a sound to a word, substitution of one sound for another, or distortion of a speech sound. 

_(Of note, speech sound disorders can include a multitude of other characteristics, not just the brief description given above.)_

## What is a Phonological Process?

**Phonological processes** are patterns of sound errors that initially serve to simplify speech as our little ones are learning to talk. Phonological processes are most commonly characterized by:

*  **Sound Substitutions**: Switching one sound for another
  * Example: substituting “T” for ‘K’ like "tea" for 'key' 
* **Sound Deletions**: Not saying all of the sounds in a word 
  * Example: saying "top" for 'stop' or saying "ca" for 'cat'
* **Sound Additions**: Adding a sound to a word
  * Example: saying "stun" for 'sun'

While these patterns of changes to words in our child's speech are expected as they grow and learn language, they sometimes can persist past the age we typically expect them to. Below you’ll find the typical age we can expect little ones to “eliminate” some of the most common phonological processes:

A speech language pathologist considers many variables to determine the best treatment approach for children who have phonological processes that persist past their expected age.
