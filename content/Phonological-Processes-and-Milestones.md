When your little one first starts to talk, your first reaction may be to film everything they say because, well, it is just so adorable when they say “Goggy ay da tick” when they were really trying to tell you "The doggy ate the stick." Those videos will be fondly watched for ages and used at birthday parties, family get togethers, and celebrations for years to come, however, depending on your child's age, they may benefit from working with a speech therapist to become more easily understood.

## Types of Speech Sound Disorders

Typically, speech sound disorders are thought of as a child having difficulty with the“R” or the “S” sounds. However, speech sound disorders is an umbrella term that can refer to many different types of speech deficits that children can have. Three of the main categories of speech sound disorders are **Childhood Apraxia of Speech (CAS),** **Phonological Processes** and **Articulation Errors**.

Typically, speech sound disorders are characterized by a deletion of a sound from a word, addition of a sound to a word, substitution of one sound for another, or distortion of a speech sound.

_(Of note, speech sound disorders can include a multitude of other characteristics, not just the brief description given above.)_

## What is a Phonological Process?

**Phonological processes** are patterns of sound errors that initially serve to simplify speech as our little ones are learning to talk. Phonological processes are most commonly characterized by:

* **Sound Substitutions**: Switching one sound for another
  * Example: substituting “T” for ‘K’ like "tea" for 'key'
* **Sound Deletions**: Not saying all of the sounds in a word
  * Example: saying "top" for 'stop' or saying "ca" for 'cat'
* **Sound Additions**: Adding a sound to a word
  * Example: saying "stun" for 'sun'

While these patterns of changes to words in our child's speech are expected as they grow and learn language, they can sometimes persist past the age we typically expect them to. Below you’ll find a chart with a list of the most common phonological processes, the typical age we can expect little ones to “eliminate” them, and an example of each:

## How do we fix my child's speech?

After speaking and meeting with a speech language pathologist, they may recommend therapy to work on your child's speech skills and phonological processes. There are a variety of approaches that an SLP may choose to take with your child and there is no "best" approach for every child.

When deciding on a therapy approach, a speech therapist considers many variables. First, an SLP considers how many phonological processes your child may have and the types of phonological processes your child may have. They also may consider your child's confidence level with their speech, attention span to certain tasks, and level of importance to lead to the most improvement. Additionally, an SLP may change approaches during intervention to best meet the needs of your child.

Some intervention approaches can include:

* **Minimal Pairs:**
* **Cycles**
* **Multiple Oppositions**
* **Maximal Oppositions**

A speech language pathologist considers many variables to determine the best treatment approach for children who have phonological processes that persist past their expected age.
