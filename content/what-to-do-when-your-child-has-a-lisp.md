When our kids have speech errors, it often sounds cute at a young age. But what happens when they continue to get older but their speech stays the same? Lisp? Meet speech therapy.

## What is a lisp?

When people hear **lisp**, they often think of kids who say TH for S (example: "think" for sink). What many don't know, however, are there are three other types of lisps _and_ sounds other than S can be lisped.

### The types of Lisps

* **Frontal Lisp:** When the tongue comes out for S and it sounds like TH. This is the lisp people typically think of.
* **Dentalized Lisp:** When the tongue sounds like TH, but the tongue doesn't come out past the teeth all the way
* **Palatal Lisp:** When S sounds like SH.
* **Lateral Lisp:** When your child's S sounds slushy. It may sound like there is an excess saliva while your child says S

### Other sounds that can be lisped

As mentioned above, sounds other than S can be lisped. Other sounds that can be palatalized or lateralized include CH, SH, and J. Treatment for these sounds often require specialized speech therapy.

## Can I fix my kid's lisp?

If you suspect your child has a lisp or any other articulatory errors, it is recommended to reach out to a speech therapist for a formal evaluation and professional recommendation. This is especially true for palatal and lateral lisps as they are not a part of typical development, meaning your child will not "outgrow" a lisp.

If your child is saying TH for S and has a frontal lisp, there are some strategies you can try at home. First, it is important to note that saying TH for S is typical for kids until 4 years old. Check out the following tips for fixing lisps at home:

* Repeat, don't correct
  * When you notice your child lisp on a word, don't point it out and tell them they said S "wrong", simply repeat what they said while exaggerating the sound correctly (example: You went on the **ssss**wings after lunch? How fun!!)
* Bring the focus to _your_ mouth
* When playing with or talking about a toy, bring the toy up to your mouth-level. This will allow your child to focus on the speech production and see how you say it
* Teach a metaphor
  * Instead of talking about the S sound, change the thought process around speech. Maybe talk about how their tongue is a snake and their teeth are the cage; they need to keep the snake in the cage for the snake sound!
* Have _them_ be the teachers
  * Tell your child that they need to try and catch you when you "let the snake out of its cage".

## When does my kid need speech therapy?

You may see those strategies above and think, _why does my son need speech therapy?_ or _Does my daughter need speech therapy_ _if I can do it myself?_

While the above strategies may work, as mentioned above there are several different types of lisps. While some are developmental, and your child may grow out of it, others are not and require individualized treatment. If you have any concerns about your child's speech, reach out to a speech therapist for a consultation or evaluation to discuss your options.
