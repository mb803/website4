* **Receptive language** is our understanding of language. This can involve understanding directions in the classroom, understanding a story a classmate shares or a teacher reads aloud,  learning what new words mean, phonological awareness skills, and more.
* **Expressive language** is how we use language to communicate with others. This can involve vocabulary, use of appropriate grammatical markers like pronouns, past tense verbs, and more, telling stories, answering questions,  and more.

To have the most effective treatment possible, it is best to diagnose and treat language disorders as early as possible. If you find your child is having difficulty expressing themselves or understanding language, we can help guide you through the next steps to take.
