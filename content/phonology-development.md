**Phonological Errors**

When your little one first starts to talk, your first reaction may be to film everything they say because, well, it is just so adorable when they try to tell you the “Goggy ay da tick” (doggy ate the stick). Those videos will be fondly watched for ages and used at birthday parties, family get togethers, and celebrations for years to come as a reminder of their innocence. Depending on their age, however, that child may benefit from working with a speech therapist.

Typically, speech errors can be broken down into two main categories: **phonological** and **articulatory**. Some speech sound irregularities are expected as our little ones grow and develop, but if they persist may need further intervention.

**Phonological processes** are patterns of sound errors that initially serve to simplify speech as our little ones are learning to talk. Sometimes, however, these patterns persist past the age we typically expect them to. Below you’ll find the typical age we can expect little ones to “eliminate” some of the most common phonological processes:

A speech language pathologist considers many variables to determine the best treatment approach for children who have phonological processes that persist past their expected age.

Do you have concerns about your child’s speech development?
