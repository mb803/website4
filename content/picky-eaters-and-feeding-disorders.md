Eating is not only a vital activity needed for survival, but often an activity that is done while enjoying time with others. We understand it can be stressful when your child has difficulty with food and are here to help.

Babies and toddlers typically learn how to suck, bite, chew, and swallow food and drinks as they grow, but oftentimes, some children have difficulty with these milestones and need additional support through feeding therapy. Additionally, if your child only eats certain foods, brands, colors, or textures and dislikes trying new foods, they may be considered a picky eater.

We will work together through a team-based approach to best support your child by incorporating new strategies at home and by exploring new foods and textures through fun and engaging therapy sessions.
