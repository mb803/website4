## What is Early Intervention?

**Early Intervention** is therapy that is specifically geared for babies and children ages birth to three years old. Early intervention aims to help children with developmental delays and disorders. It follows the ideology that the earlier you get help for your child, the more progress they can make; this is the _opposite_ mindset of "wait and see".  Early intervention services can include:

* Speech Therapy
* Feeding Therapy
* Occupational Therapy
* Physical Therapy
* Developmental Therapy
* Psychological Therapy
* Audiological and/or Vision Therapy
* Medical, Nutrition, or Nursing Therapy

## I think my child is delayed, should I wait and see?

At MollyBSLP, we feel that the _wait and see_ method is outdated. Years ago, concerned parents were encouraged to believe children will _grow out of it_. Nowadays, however, we know that your child's brain is developing and learning at an extremely quick rate and children's brains and more flexible and receptive to learning now than ever.

Looking at language, specifically, children learn language by watching, listening, and eventually imitating during back-and-forth play and interactions. Our babies who are delayed and have a harder time communicating than their peers may miss out in those important turn-taking moments and ultimately fall further behind. Early intervention can help our little ones learn the power and value of communication.

## How do I get into Early Intervention?

Early Intervention is a program that is most often organized by your state legislature. If you have concerns for your baby's development, it is recommended to first speak with your doctor and then to call your state's early intervention program and request an evaluation to assess if your child is eligible for services.

You will then be put into contact with a service coordinator to gather information about your child and set a plan in motion for evaluations. Following an evaluation, if your child is deemed eligible for services, you and your team of therapists will work together for form an **Individualized Family Service Plan** with functional goals to work towards.

### What if my child didn't qualify for early intervention, but I am still concerned?

It is important to note that not _all_ children qualify for services through early intervention following full evaluations. If you are still concerned about your child's development and skills, consider private speech therapy either through a provider that is in-network with your private health insurance or an out-of-network provider, like us at MollyBSLP.

## What does early intervention look like?

Early intervention typically follows a parent-coaching approach. This approach considers the fact that you, the parent or caretaker, are with your child for almost all of their waking hours... however therapists are only with him approximately 30-60 minutes a week. Thus, best practice is for therapists to coach all caregivers to use different strategies with your child outside of therapy.

Early Intervention therapists want to use your toys, your routines, and your activities in therapy and help brainstorm ideas of different strategies and adjustments to make to help your child grow and develop even more.
