Parent and caregiver coaching serves to empower parents with strategies to support communication within daily routines with your child who may have a language delay. When equipped with the right tools, parents can foster a positive language-learning environment at home. In our sessions, we will work together, as a team, to discuss, practice, and plan for using different strategies in daily routines with your little ones.
