When equipped with the right tools, parents can foster a positive language-learning environment at home.

Intervention will initially focus on developing the skills needed to be met before we expect language out of little ones. This can include joint attention, expanding play skills, teaching basic concepts and early vocabulary, and increasing their overall understanding and use of language. 

In our sessions, we will work together, as a team, to discuss, practice, and plan for using different strategies in daily routines with your little ones.
