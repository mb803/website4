Motor speech disorders require highly individualized treatment sessions that follow the principles of motor learning to best support your child. Signs of a common motor speech disorder, childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) include: inconsistent errors,  difficulty putting sounds and syllables into longer words and utterances, limited babbling as a baby, limited consonants and vowel sounds, and oral groping. We are trained in using PROMPT and DTTC techniques in our sessions to promote progress in your child's speech.
