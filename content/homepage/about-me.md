##### About Me

Molly Brown, M.S. CCC-SLP, is a New York and New Jersey licensed speech-language pathologist certified by the American Speech Hearing Association (ASHA) . She received both her Bachelor’s degree in Speech Language Pathology and Audiology and her Master’s degree in Speech Language Pathology at Ithaca College in Ithaca, NY.

Molly has experience providing speech and language therapy in a variety of settings including teletherapy, schools, outpatient clinics, and in client’s homes. She has provided assessment and intervention to children and adults with language delays, autism, expressive and receptive language disorders, articulation and phonological disorders, social-pragmatic language disorders, fluency disorders, and cognitive impairments.

Molly places a high value on continuing education and is trained in Prompts for Restructuring Oral/Muscular Phonetic Targets (PROMPT) and DTTC (Dynamic Temporal and Tactile Cueing) for clients with speech-sound disorders. She is also a certified Hanen instructor for It Takes Two to Talk, a course geared towards early language development and parent coaching.

In her free time, Molly can be found out for a run, playing fetch with her pup, or playing video games with friends.
