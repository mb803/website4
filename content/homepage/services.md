## Articulation and Phonological Therapy

Do you or others have a hard time understanding your child?

We know that it can be frustrating when your child isn’t able to be easily understood when sharing wonderful stories about their day, interests, and dreams.

* A child with an articulation disorder may have difficulty with one or more specific sounds that impact their overall ability to be effectively understood.
* A child with a phonological disorder may have difficulty producing patterns of speech sounds. For example, the phonological process of “cluster reduction”, refers to a child who typically says 1 sound instead of 2 when consonants are next to teacher; a child who says “top” for stop or “sick” for stick would be identified with this phonological pattern.

As children grow up, their sound development follows a typical hierarchy; it is expected for young children to make some speech errors as they grow. We can assess your child for their sound-production in words, sentences, and conversation to determine if they would benefit from therapeutic services.
