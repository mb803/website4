Welcome to MollyB SLP, where we provide individualized treatment that best fits the needs your child and your family.

Speech and language services are currently offered in-home, virtually, or within the community (parks, libraries). In order to best serve each client, we work with parents to determine the most appropriate setting for the childâ€™s needs. Secondary to covid-19 safety measures, we will be providing in-home speech therapy while wearing masks and gloves and carefully sanitizing all materials before and after each session. Virtual sessions will be conducted on Zoom and will offer the same high-quality care from the comfort of your home. Every session, whether in-person or online, is carefully planned to include interactive and engaging activities to ensure your child is making progress towards their goals.
